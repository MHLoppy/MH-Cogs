## Credits
* autopost_v3 is based on [TrustyJAID's weather cog](https://github.com/TrustyJAID/Trusty-cogs) and draws from own [v2 version of the same cog](https://github.com/MHLoppy/Autopost-v2), which itself is based on a previous weather cog by rfilkins1992 & Will. The API key used is from TrustyJAID's cog!
